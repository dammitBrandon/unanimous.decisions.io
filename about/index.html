                    We will focus strongly on leadership and emotional intelligence. As the two
                    go hand in hand, we plan to mirror “The Leadership Challenge” by Kouzes
                    &amp; Posner. We use this to demonstrate the strong qualities of leadership,
                    which include the five practices of exemplary leadership. Being able to
                    control yourself and manage your relationship with others is extremely
                    important in professional life, which is defined by emotional intelligence.
                    We will be teaching and providing the tools necessary to guide the
                    individual in right path of self-awareness, social awareness, relationship
                    management, and motivation.
