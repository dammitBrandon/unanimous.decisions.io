            <h3>Lets talk about it!</h3>
            <p>
                Unanimous Decisions is a newly formed nonprofit organized to assist youth
                in using critical thinking skills to get the best result out of any situation and
                enable them to become better students, make career choices, say no to
                violence, manage anger, resolve conflict, respond to bullying without force,
                say no to drugs and gangs and manage relationships. The organization
                promotes the use of physical training, mentoring and cognitive-behavioral
                groups to support youth in their development. Unanimous Decisions has an
                engaged Board of Directors that is led by Larry Bailey, the executive
                director. Mr. Bailey has more than 30 years of experience training
                professional boxers and more than seven years of experience mentoring
                youth Golden Diversity. Some of his trainees have been Robert “Boo Boo”
                Sawyer, (ESPN Champion), Marion “Jack Hammer“ Wilson (Tri-State
                Heavy Weight Champ). Sugar Ray Leonard (five time Champ) with the
                Marvin Haggler Fight. Darrel “too sweet“ Coley to name a few. He has
                helped numerous of youth by translating the rule of boxing to rules
                governing behavior at home, school and in the community.

                We will focus strongly on leadership and emotional intelligence. As the two
                go hand in hand, we plan to mirror “The Leadership Challenge” by Kouzes
                &amp; Posner. We use this to demonstrate the strong qualities of leadership,
                which include the five practices of exemplary leadership. Being able to
                control yourself and manage your relationship with others is extremely
                important in professional life, which is defined by emotional intelligence.
                We will be teaching and providing the tools necessary to guide the
                individual in right path of self-awareness, social awareness, relationship
                management, and motivation.

                The value that the program brings is to help bolster the youth with positive
                activities. Such activities will gear them towards:
            <ul>
                <li>Youth Feel Physically and Emotionally Safe</li>
                <li>Youth Experience Belonging and Ownership</li>
                <li>Youth Develop Self-Worth</li>
                <li>Youth Discover Self</li>
                <li>Youth Develop Quality Relationships with Peers and Adults</li>
                <li>Youth Discuss Conflicting Values and Form Their Own</li>
                <li>Youth Feel the Pride and Accountability that Comes with Mastery</li>
                <li>Youth Expand Their Capacity to Enjoy Life and Know that Success is Possible</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
