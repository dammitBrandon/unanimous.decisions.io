                        (= me).
                        I started it as a way to both test my <strong>skel</strong> framework and sharpen up my coding
                        and design skills a bit.</p>

                    <p><strong>Skel</strong> is a lightweight framework for building responsive
                        sites and apps. All of my stuff at <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> (including this
                        one) are built on this framework.</p>
